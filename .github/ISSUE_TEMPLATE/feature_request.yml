        ## MoSCoW Prioritization
        We use the MoSCoW method to prioritize features:
        - **Must Have**: Critical for the solution to be a success
        - **Should Have**: Important but not vital
        - **Could Have**: Nice to have if resources permit
        - **Won't Have**: Not priority for this time box
